I am currently studying Information Technology help desk at Ivy Tech Community College and had previously graduated form James Madison Univeristy with a degree in Dietetics. I am very passionate about healthy eating, because I believe food is medicine and medicine is food. With the world becoming technological and computerized, I believe branching into that field will help promote any course and even do more and expand my horizon
I also work with Inova Health Systems and would want to diversify and venture into Information Technology.
